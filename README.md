# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview.
In this project we are creating a web application from data collected by web scraping different websites related to Mars. The objective is to create an HTML file where we can visualize all the information gathered from web scraping every time we want.

## Resources
* Chrome Developer Tools
* Splinter
* BeautifulSoup
* MongoDB
* Flask
* Pandas

## Results.
We used Chrome Dev Tools to identify all the HTML components we want to extract from each website. Then we used Splinter and Beautiful Soup, to automate a web browser and extract the data we needed from each website, we stored the data in a MongoDB and finally used Flask to display all our findings in a html file, that looks like the one below.
